we used python to change the written words into numbers that the computer is able to understand and then we were able to predict the these factors and so predict credit risk on who will be able to pay back the loan and who wont be able

## Results
We were able to determine the people that would be able to pay back the loans based on the information that was provided and the risk that is given with the loans. we determined that its not proper to give younger people big loans and that, its easier for females to pay back the loans, we noticed that as people get older, and are more stable they are paying back the loans
we determined that not all features are valuable in the  payiong back of the loan and this was showed by the features as shown in the features table 

## Summary
Machine Learning uses a variety of techniques to predict the credit score of a person and determine if the person will be able to pay back the loan that has been given to him. we understood the oversampling, undersampling and the combination method and were able to use all the 3 and determine the outcomes of credit and hence know the shortfalls of each method and how best thye can be mitigated
